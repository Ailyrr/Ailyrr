👋 Hi, I’m Cornell (aka Ailyrr)

I'm a student, gamer, and developer passionate about building web applications and exploring new technologies. Currently, I'm deep-diving into both Frontend & Backend Development, always looking for new challenges to tackle.
🚀 Currently Learning

    ⚡ Next.js – Building modern, fast web applications

    🦀 Rust – Low-level programming with high performance

    🐘 PHP – Backend development for dynamic websites

    🇯🇵 Japanese – Because why not make life even harder? 😆

🔥 Current Projects

I'm actively working on multiple projects, all tied to Helvetica Esports, an esports organization I'm building with friends:
🎮 Helvetica Esports Projects:

    🏆 Main Website – A full-featured web app for managing teams, events, and community engagement

    🤖 Discord Bot – Integrated with our website backend for seamless interaction in our Discord Server

    🎥 OBS Companion App – A tool for managing VALORANT streams with real-time text editing features
