- 👋 Hi, I’m Cornell (aka Ailyrr)
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding and Video producing🎥
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#🤓

I am still learning a lot and if you see my code and have a comment, critique or anything feel ✨**Free**✨ to say it! :)
I'm also open to any collab between other learning developpers, I'm sure it would be a great learning experience!
